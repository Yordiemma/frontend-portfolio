# Reflection – Fundamentals Part 1: Personal Website

## What I learned during this project
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control.  
- How to publish a site using GitHub Pages.  
- How to build a responsive layout with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and fluid typography using `clamp()`.  
- How to organize a personal site with sections like About, Skills, Projects, Education, and Hobbies.  

## My biggest challenge and how I approached it
The biggest challenge was making the site fully **responsive** on different screen sizes.  
I improved it a lot using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries, but I know it still needs more polishing.  

Another challenge was making the **project images** look consistent. At first, one project image looked taller than the other. I experimented with CSS rules like `object-fit: cover` and fixed heights. It looks better now, but I’m still not fully happy with it and want to continue improving this part.  

## If I was stuck, how I moved forward
When I got stuck, I:  
- Used the browser DevTools to test and debug my CSS.  
- Made small commits so I could go back if something broke.  
- Looked at documentation and tutorials online and I used AI.  

These steps helped me to move forward without getting too frustrated.  

## What I am most proud of
- The site is **responsive** and works well on desktop and mobile.  
- It has a **clean and professional look** while still showing my personality.  
- It represents me with my skills, projects, education, and hobbies all in one place.
